    "(b) Try taking $T$ larger (perhaps $6\\pi, 8\\pi$, or larger) and see what kinds of solutions you can find. You will probably observe that Newton's method is very sensitive to the initial guess and often diverges (note that if it's going to converge, it usually won't take more than 10 iterations to do so). Make sure your initial guess satisfies the boundary conditions, and try adjusting it until you find some solutions. Can you find two initial guesses that are very close but converge to very different final solutions? You may also find solutions that have \"boundary layers\" (see section 2.17 of the text, if you're interested). Try to explain what physical behavior each solution corresponds to. "
